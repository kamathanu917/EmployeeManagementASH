To normalize the given tables and better represent the data, we can create separate tables for Employees, Managers, and Supervisors, and then create a common table for personal information. Additionally, we can create a table for business expenses for managers. Here's how we can do it:

Employees Table:
	EmployeeID (Primary Key)
	FirstName
	LastName
	Address1

Managers Table:
	ManagerID (Primary Key)
	EmployeeID (Foreign Key referencing Employees.EmployeeID)
	AnnualSalary

Supervisors Table:
	SupervisorID (Primary Key)
	EmployeeID (Foreign Key referencing Employees.EmployeeID)
	AnnualSalary

EmployeeDetails Table:
	EmployeeID (Primary Key)
	PayPerHour (Only for Employees)

BusinessExpenses Table:
	ExpenseID (Primary Key)
	ManagerID (Foreign Key referencing Managers.ManagerID)
	MaxExpenseAmount
	
This schema allows for better organization of data, reduces redundancy, and ensures data integrity through the use of foreign key constraints.
